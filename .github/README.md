The Rotating Dice puzzle, built on the Visual Thinking `RelatedPair` puzzle template, presents a set of two dice and challenges the player to visually determine whether or not it is possible, given the three visible sides of each die, for the first die to be rotated in such a way as to appear identical to the second die. If the player has difficulty determining this by visual inspection alone, each die may be picked up, examined, rotated, and placed back down in order to assist the player in solving the puzzle.
